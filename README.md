# KitchenZoom (Canteen Management System)
KitchenZoom is a final year major project web-application, build to manage canteen's activity of our (Silicon Institute of Technology, Sambalpur) college.

We are heading towards both problems and solutions of the canteen. Modern handheld devices such as phones and PDAs (Personal DigitalAssistant) have become increasingly powerful in recent years. In particular, most cell phones generally include cameras, internet access etc. However, even with all these added facilities, there are few applications that allow much passing of environmental conservation and an easier way to provide reliable services and save products. One application that falls into this category is the “Solution to the Canteen Management” or “KitchenZoom” developed both for mobile and web-users.
